                    in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge
                    and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss
                    in trading Digital Assets, especially entering into Perpetual Contracts, can be substantial. You
                    should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your
                    circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you
                    have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and
                    investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets, including
                    Perpetual Contracts. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication,
                    professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any
                    transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all
                    consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital
                    Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in
                    these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to
                    you in connection with, your use of the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions,
                    including entering into Perpetual Contracts.</li>

                  <li>You understand that the Protocol remains under development, which creates technological, trading,
                    and other risks when using the Services. These risks include, among others, delays in trades,
                    withdrawals, and deposits resulting from the servers of Protocol or the operator of the Protocol
                    being offline; an incorrect display of information on the Site in the case of server errors; or
                    transactions using the Services being rolled back in the case of server errors. You acknowledge that
                    these risks may have material impact on your transactions using the Services, which may result in,
                    among other things, failing to fulfill transactions at your desired price or at all.</li>
                  <li>You understand that you are responsible for all trades you place, including any erroneous orders
                    that may be filled. We do not take any action to resolve erroneous trades that result from your
                    errors.</li>
                  <li>You hereby assume and agree that neither Protocol nor VT will have have responsibility or
                    liability for the risks set forth in this Section</li>

                  to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Protocol wishes to settle, and if so, on
                  what terms, and you agree to cooperate with Protocol and VT in the defense.</p>

              <li><span class="font-bold">DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</span>
                <p class="my-4">Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain
                  disputes and claims with the Protocol or VT and limits how you can seek relief from Protocol or VT.
                  Also, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</p>
                <p class="my-4">You and Protocol and VT agree that any dispute arising out of or related to theseTerms
                  or the Services is personal to you and the Protocol or VT and that any dispute will be resolved solely
                  through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other
                  type of representative proceeding.</p>
                <p class="my-4">Except for small claims disputes in which you or Protocol or VT seeks to bring an
                  individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in
                  which you or Protocol or VT seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
                  intellectual property, you and Protocol or VT waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any
                  dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court. Instead, for any
                  dispute or claim that you have against Protocol or VT or relating in any way to the Services, you
                  agree to first contact Protocol or VT and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written
                  notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Protocol or VT by email at legal@Crustexchange.io The Notice must (a)
                  include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and
                  basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in
                  form to that described above. If you and Protocol or VT cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim
                  within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to
                  binding arbitration administered by an arbitrator appointed by the Protocol and or VT.</p>
                <p class="my-4">You and Protocol or VT agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the
                  enforceability of this Section 12 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal
                  Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
                  As limited by the FAA, these Terms and appointed arbitrator´s rules, the arbitrator will have
                  exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to
                  grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the
                  question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not
                  consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative
                  proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
                <p class="my-4">The arbitrator, Protocol or VT , and you will maintain the confidentiality of any
                  arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including all information gathered, prepared, and
                  presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will
                  have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality unless the law provides to
                  the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to
                  prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application
                  for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its
                  enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>
                <p class="my-4">You and Protocol or VT agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the
                  filing fee and all other arbitration fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Protocol or VT ,
                  Protocol or VT will pay all arbitration fees and costs. You and Protocol or VT agree that the
                  jurisdiction and governing law of the appointed arbitrator have exclusive jurisdiction over the
                  enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
                <p class="my-4">Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within
                  one (1) year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you
                  and Protocol or VT will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>
                <p class="my-4">If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any
                  reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of
                  the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this
                  Section 15 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual
                  basis under this Section 15; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class,
                  collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of
                  competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims
                  will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
                <p class="my-4">Further, if any part of this Section 15 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking
                  public injunctive relief, then that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed
                  to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be enforceable.</p>

                  Terms, the Site or the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the applicable
                  laws relating the Protocol and or VT. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the
                  enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having jurisdiction. For any
                  other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms, the courts of the jurisdiction
                  applicable to the Protocol and VT shall have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
